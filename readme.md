## JavaScipt 30 - 30 Projects in 30 days

I took on this "course" to deepen my JS knowledge, and also to make sure I know what I will be doing each day.

As well as doing these mini projects, I am practising TDD with Jest. Each project will have a test suite that tests something on that project. I am hoping my tests keep developing as I go along with my projects.

All credit on the projects and boilerplate code goes to https://github.com/wesbos/.
